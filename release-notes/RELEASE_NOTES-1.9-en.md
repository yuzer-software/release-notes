# August 2021 - Version 1.9.0

- When taking a new appointment through the quick workshop appointment feature the title of the created basket is now the one of the selected template, or, when you edit a custom description the first line of the description.
- The model name of a vehicle is now editable.
- It is now possible to generate an export with the products in stock into a **csv**, **excel** or **txt** file.
- It is now possible to convert balance into credit event if it creates a negative balance.
- An administrator can now choose to ignore to impact the stock of products for all types of basket while invoicing (initially only possible for baskets of _vehicle preparation_ type).
- It is now possible to collect a payment with an amount greater than the basket one.

## Product category changes

We have split the "other_services_and_taxes" into "other_services" and "other_taxes" in order to provide more VAT automation in the future. However, this process cannot be fully automated and requires your attention.

We have renamed the _other_services_and_taxes_ category to _other_services_ in all catalogs, but we didn't renamed it elsewhere, especially in accountancy mapping rules.

      Please do check your accountancy rules (Accountancy > Accounts configuration)<br/>

    <li>Please do check product categories in existing opened baskets</li>
    <li>
      Please do check that products now in the "other_services" category should not be in "other_taxes" (you may use the category filter as below)<br/>

## Contacts

### Vehicle registration numbers

- The registration number of the vehicles of a contact are now displayed.

### VAT Exonerated

When creating or updating a client, you can now check "VAT exonerated" if you have a role among "ACCOUNTANT"
, "ADMIN" or "SALES_MANAGER".
A client with VTA exonerated will have his VAT set to 0% by default when adding items to a basket.

Note that the creation of a template from a basket belonging to a contact who is exonerated from VAT has been temporarily disabled.
Indeed, when we create a basket template, we currently save the price of the products as it was set on the source basket. Therefore, when the template is reapplied on a new basket, it is possible that the prices are without VAT. We plan to review the feature to avoid this kind of problem in the future.

## Negative stock

In Stock -> Stock tab, there is now a new button "Negative Stock" that will lead to a new page displaying any products having a negative stock in at least one of its location. Note that you can print the displayed page with the list of products.

## Top search improvements

Global search has been improved for more comfort. Search is now performed on

- Dealer files
- Contacts
- Products

User experience has also been improved:

- The best-matching result is now displayed on top of the list and is pre-selected; it can be immediately accessed by pressing the _enter_ key.
- Navigation in results is enabled by using the arrow keys of your keyboard (selection is done by pressing the _enter_ key).
- You can access the the search screen of dealer files/contacts/products including the current search by using the _Advanced search_ option.

Please note that searching a vehicle in supplier systems or by registration is enabled only with a minimum of 6 characters but:

- Triumph is the only manufacturer that currently enables searching a VIN with the last 6 characters.
- A registration or VIN for other manufacturers must be entered completely.
