- Supplier selection when creating a new vehicle vehicle file or product has been improved.
- We can now select which customer address to use when editing a receipt-invoice.

## Invoicing without impacting stock

When invoicing, **administrators** can now choose not to impact the stock for any basket type. To do this, simply click on the _Extended options_ button in the _Basket stock management_ window. Note that the possibility of ignoring the stock impact already exists for vehicle preparation baskets and remains available to entitled users.
